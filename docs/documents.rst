Documents
=========

Methods for drawing down, editing and uploading data about documents.

DocumentClient
--------------

.. class:: documentcloud.documents.DocumentClient

   The document client gives access to retrieval and uploading of documents.
   It is generally accessed as ``client.documents``.


   .. method:: all(self, **params)

       An alias for :meth:`list`.


   .. method:: get(id_, expand=None)

      Return the document with the provided DocumentCloud identifer. ::

           >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
           >>> client = DocumentCloud(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
           >>> client.documents.get(71072)
           <Document: Final OIR Report>

      The identifier may be just the numeric ID (71072, preferred), the old style ID-slug
      (71072-oir-final-report), or the new style slug-id (oir-final-report-71072).

      Setting expand allows for the user or organization details to be fetched with the
      document, instead of requiring a separate API request to fetch them.  Set expand to
      a list of the values you would like expanded. ::

           >>> client.documents.get(71072, expand=["user"])
           >>> client.documents.get(71072, expand=["user", "organization"])


   .. method:: list(self, **params)

      Return a list of all documents, possibly filtered by the given parameters.
      Please see the full `API documentation`_ for available parameters.


   .. method:: search(query, **params)

       Return a list of documents that match the provided query. ::

               >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
               >>> client = DocumentCloud()
               >>> obj_list = client.documents.search('Ruben Salazar')
               >>> obj_list[0]
               <Document: Final OIR Report>

      The params may be set to any parameters that the search end point takes.
      Please see the full `search documentation`_ for query syntax and available
      parameters.


   .. method:: upload(pdf, **kwargs)

      Upload a PDF to DocumentCloud. You must be authorized to do this. Returns
      the object representing the new record you've created. You can submit either
      a file path or a file object.

           >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
           >>> client = DocumentCloud(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
           >>> new_id = client.documents.upload("/home/ben/test.pdf", "Test PDF")
           >>> # Now fetch it
           >>> client.documents.get(new_id)
           <Document: Test PDF>

       You can also use URLs which link to PDFs, if that's the kind of thing you
       want to do.

           >>> upload("http://ord.legistar.com/Chicago/attachments/e3a0cbcb-044d-4ec3-9848-23c5692b1943.pdf")

       You may set the ``kwargs`` to any of the writable attributes as described
       in :meth:`documentcloud.documents.Document.put`.  Additionally, you may set ``force_ocr`` in
       order to force OCR to take place even if the document has embedded text, as
       well as either ``project`` to the ID of a project to upload the document
       into, or ``projects``, a list of project IDs to upload the document into.


   .. method:: upload_directory(path, handle_errors=False, **kwargs)

      Searches through the provided path and attempts to upload all the PDFs it
      can find. Metadata, which accepts the same keywords as :meth:`upload`,
      provided to the other keyword arguments will be recorded for all uploads
      (except for title which will be set based on the filename). Returns a
      list of document objects that are created. Be warned, this will upload
      any documents in directories inside the path you specify.  The
      handle_errors parameter will catch and print errors generated by the
      network request or the DocumentCloud API, log them, and try to continue
      processing.  This might be useful if you are uploading a very large
      directory and do not want temporary network problems to stop the entire
      upload.

           >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
           >>> client = DocumentCloud(DOCUMENTCLOUD_USERNAME, DOCUMENTCLOUD_PASSWORD)
           >>> obj_list = client.documents.upload_directory('/home/ben/pdfs/groucho_marx/')
